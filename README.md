#Problem Generator with Express
A simple Node.js/Express app that generates homework problems (physics, chemistry, calculus) based on a student’s stated interests. Uses in-memory data for demonstration purposes—no actual database setup required.

Features
User Signup: Create a user profile with a username, subject list, and interests (e.g., “space,” “sports,” etc.).
Dynamic Problem Generation: Generates random problem parameters in physics, chemistry, or calculus, then injects user interests into the problem text.
In-Memory Storage: Stores users in a JavaScript object for demo purposes—easy to replace with a real database.
